I developed this project using Java for the application logic and MariaDB SQL for data storage. It is designed to be a functional system for managing appointments in hair salons.

The application allows users to book appointments, view available time slots, and manage their reservations. Hairdressers can access their schedules and update appointment statuses. The system ensures smooth data handling through a well-structured database, making it efficient for real-world use.
